# Drum-Kit-DOM-jQuery

A simple static webpage (html/css) that lets a user play different drum sounds by either clicking on different images or by pressing down specific letters on the keyboard. 

The logic is executed separately in either the index.js file that uses standard Javascript and the Document Object Model (DOM) API, or in the jQuery.js file that runs the same logic, but uses jQuery syntax instead.
